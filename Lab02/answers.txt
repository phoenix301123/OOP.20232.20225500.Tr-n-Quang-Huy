1. If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Yes, Java allows us to create multiple constructor methods in a class, we just have to make sure that the parameter list are all different
from each other.

2. Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
JAVA is a Pass by Value programming language.

3. After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?
Because we are only swapping the references held by the local variables o1, o2 not the actual objects they point to, therefore the
title remains unchanged.

4. After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?
When dvd.setTitle(title) was called, the state of the object that dvd refers to is being modified directly inside the method, therefore the
title of the JungleDVD was changed.
